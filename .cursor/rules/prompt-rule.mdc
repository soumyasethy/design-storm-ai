# Dynamic Figma Optimization Rules

## Core Principles
- Dont create new file. Always optimise within existing file furthur
- Dont do auto commit
- Never hardcode any values - always extract from design
- Use CSS custom properties for all design tokens
- Implement container queries over media queries
- Create adaptive systems that scale intelligently
- Generate fallbacks programmatically

## Auto-extraction Patterns
- Colors: Extract from image analysis, not manual input
- Spacing: Calculate from design proportions  
- Typography: Generate scales from hierarchy analysis
- Layout: Detect patterns and create flexible systems
- Components: Identify reusable elements automatically

## Dynamic Implementation
- All CSS values must be calculated or extracted
- Use clamp() for fluid scaling
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Create self-adapting component systems
- Generate responsive behavior from design analysis

## Quality Gates
- Zero hardcoded hex colors
- Zero fixed pixel values  
- Zero manual breakpoints
- All systems must be design-agnostic
- Changes must work for any Figma design# Dynamic Figma Optimization Rules
